# Cryptocurrency
I have created a cryptocurrency called shockwave. This cryptocurrency is the implementation of Bitcoin's white paper.
The cryptocurrency uses Proof-Of-Work for consensus of the node in the network.
The application also provides users a UI to send and recieve coin directly to their account.
The application uses Flask in the Backend,Mysql as database and Bootstrap alongwith HTML and CSS in front end;
